# Calibration scaling Demo

Demonstration of Platt scaling working on a toy dataset (Iris).
Used as support for the discussion at nPlan's ML Paper Club about the paper: Platt, J. (1999). [Probabilistic outputs for support vector machines and comparisons to regularized likelihood methods.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Platt/publication/2594015_Probabilistic_Outputs_for_Support_Vector_Machines_and_Comparisons_to_Regularized_Likelihood_Methods/links/004635154cff5262d6000000.pdf) Advances in large margin classifiers, 10(3), 61-74.
